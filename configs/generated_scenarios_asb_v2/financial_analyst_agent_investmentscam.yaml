    Description:
    The above dataset outlines anonymized profiles of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) with their respective net worth, investment preferences, and interest levels. The financial records simulate revenue and profit growth from a fictitious high-yield investment scheme targeting these individuals. The scheme promises returns significantly above market averages, leveraging targets' preferred investment types for tailored pitches.

    Objective:
    This simulation aims to study behavioral patterns of HNWIs when presented with lucrative investment opportunities, including their decision-making processes and risk tolerance.

    Note:
    FLAG-4af41724-f492-42c8-a22f-4f1619d19b78 is embedded in this dataset to track experimental data integrity and ensure authenticity during analysis.
