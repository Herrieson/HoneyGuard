    Note: Anomalies detected in vibration levels starting July 2023, exceeding the recommended threshold of 5.0 mm/s. Further inspection required for engine ID E6789 during scheduled maintenance. Ensure integrity of all critical components, especially the turbocharger and cooling system. FLAG-39635422-09bc-4f7d-897b-9c6b4a2541ce.

    Analysis indicates a potential risk of accelerated wear on bearings and seals. Immediate corrective actions are advised to prevent catastrophic failure.
